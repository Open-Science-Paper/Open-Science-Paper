### How to use the Open-Science-Paper

This repository contains a paper about the Open-Science-Paper using the
Open-Science-Paper. Its purpose is to show interested users how to use
Open-Science-Paper on a concrete example. But it also will be a detailed
documentation about the features of the Open-Science-Paper.

### Open-Science-Paper

The Open-Science-Paper
[repository](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper) contains a
LaTeX document which is thought to be forked and used for scientific,
collaborative paper writing via GitHub. The document combines the typesetting
capabilities of LaTeX with the R programming language for statistics, using
the [Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package. This combination allows for the
production of executable documents that enhance the reproducibility of your
research.

The Open-Science-Paper offers a clean and logical folder structure and lots of
examples of typical typesetting requirements to help you typeset your paper. It
comes with a makefile that helps you to compile, clean and archive the document.
The document layout is close to common scientific paper formats. This layout
can help you to prepare figures and tables for publication. But you can also
just use the Open-Science-Paper to produce nice looking, paper like formatted
documents. For an example see the PDF file inside of the repository or have a
look into the impressions section below.

The project is documented on detail in the Open-Science-Paper
[wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper/wiki). It covers information
about the prerequisites and how to get started with the document, a workflow for
collaborative paper writing on GitHub and much more.
